A brand new Mendel! I called it the 2012.

I wanted to make the current version of the Prusa Mendel before I modified it to try to understand why things were done as they were. Been there, done that. Now for the mods!

After many people urging me to do so, I decided to rename this machine from Prusa Mendel 2012 to Ronthomp Mendel. I appreciate all the encouragement and support!
